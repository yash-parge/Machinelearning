# Convolutional Neural Networks
Predicting patterns based on a simple 3 layer supervised deep learning model built in python using the numpy library.
Simple neural network with 3 (plus one bias) input nodes 5 hidden nodes and 1 output node.
## Bias
Bias for the first layer is added via an additional coloumn in the training data with the value of 1 on all rows.
Bias for the hidden layer is added via a conventional method.
## Training data
A trial dataset has been provided but modifications will be needed in the code to run it properly.
